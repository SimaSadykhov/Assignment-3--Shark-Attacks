  <h1>Comparing Shark Attacks in the United States</h1>

  <p>

    In both 2023 and 2024, there were 36 shark attacks that occurred in the United States. Both years also had the highest 

    number of shark attacks in Florida. Florida is known to be one of the warmer states with warm water, which is what sharks prefer. 

    This state is also one of the most populated states when it comes to visitors because of its warm weather, giving it a higher 

    chance of there being shark attacks at beaches. The number of attacks in that state from 2023 and 2024 increased. While itâ€™s 

    not surprising to see there were shark attacks in the southern, warm states, there were a couple of shocking results that occurred 

    in 2023: New York having 4 shark attacks and New Jersey having 1. However, there were no reported shark attacks in those states 

    in 2024.
